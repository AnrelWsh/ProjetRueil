// HOW TO PUT YOUR WEBSITE ONLINE WITH VERCEL AND GITHUB //

Create a Vercel account on vercel.com
Link your Vercel account with your Github
Start a new project 
Import the Github repository on your project and deploy

CONGRATULATIONS ! You just deployed your project on Vercel ! You can now access it with the “vercel.app” link.


// ADD IMGBOT TO YOUR REPOSITORY // 
Go in your repo’s marketplace
Set up your Imgbot plan (the free one is enough)
Then your Imgbot will have access to your repo and will send you pull request

And that’s all ! Now your website’s images will be compressed and optimised !


// ADD OTHER WORKFLOWS //
Go into your repo’s actions
Now you can configure a suggested workflow or set up another by yourself (it will be the same process, the difference is that you can choose many others in the set up section)
Now that you had chosen your workflow, copy its code
Paste it in the document at its left
Now click the commit and that's all !


PS: you will have to pull your code before being able to push it 


// GET A DISCORD NOTIFICATION AT EACH COMMIT WITH ZAPIER //
Go to zapier.com
Create an account
Choose the apps you want to connect each other (in our case, we will connect GITHUB and DISCORD)
Then you have to choose the trigger and the action. Choose “New Commit” as trigger and “Send Channel Message” as action
Click “Make a zap” and “Get a started”
Connect your Github account, your repo and your head
Choose your Discord Account, your channel and your message.
Then make a test the zap
And turn it on and you're done !

Now, when you’ll make a commit, you will receive a Discord notification. Isn’t that incredible?!!
